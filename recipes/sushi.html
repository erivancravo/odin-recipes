    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup of water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup medium-grain white rice, uncooked</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li>4 ounces smoked salmon, cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>4 scallions, sliced into thin strips</li>
    </ul>


    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>            
            <p>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan.<br>
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer<br>
            until rice is tender and water has been absorbed,<br>
            20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool,<br>
            about 10 minutes. Toss with vinegar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place 1 sheet of nori on a rolling mat, layer<br>
            with 1/4 of the rice, and press rice out to the<br>
            edges. Lay 1/4 of the salmon, 1/4 of the cream<br> 
            cheese, and 1/4 of the scallions in the center. Roll<br>
            up carefully and wrap in plastic wrap. Repeat with<br>
            remaining nori, rice, salmon, cream cheese, and<br>
            scallions. Place in the refrigerator until chilled,<br>
            at least 1 hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove sushi rolls from the refrigerator,<br>
            discard plastic wrap, and cut each roll into<br>
            6 slices. Layer all rolls on a platter.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
